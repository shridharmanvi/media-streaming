# This is docker build for media streaming server

This build is based off of Kurento Open source project:
https://doc-kurento.readthedocs.io/en/6.6.1/index.html
https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-docker/tree/master/kurento-media-server

* Build the docker image by running 
`docker build -t manvishri/mediastreaming-server:latest .`

# Future enhancements
* Using docker compose, build a service that starts kurento media streaming server and the demo video broadcast app
